# Superfast Sass Plugin
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tyler-johnson/superfast-sass.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tyler-johnson/superfast-sass)

Adds sass/scss integration to a [Superfast](http://ghub.io/superfast) application. To use, simply add this package to your application using the following command:

```
$ sf add superfast-sass
```

And that's it! Now you can launch your application and `.scss` files will be automatically transformed into css for the browser.
