# Superfast Sass Plugin

Adds sass/scss integration to a [Superfast](http://ghub.io/superfast) application. To use, simply add this package to your application using the following command:

```
$ sf add superfast-sass
```

And that's it! Now you can launch your application and `.scss` files will be automatically transformed into css for the browser.
